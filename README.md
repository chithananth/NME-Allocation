# NME-Allocation
The "NME Allocation System" is a bespoke solution crafted specifically for V.H.N.S.N. College (Autonomous), Virudhunagar, to revolutionize the process of allocating non-major elective (NME) subjects to students. This innovative system replaces the conventional manual allocation method with an intuitive and efficient platform, facilitating administrators in assigning NME subjects to students based on predetermined criteria. Moreover, it incorporates mechanisms for reallocation in instances of initial misallocation, ensuring that students are appropriately assigned elective subjects. The system is developed using PHP and HTML for UI as Front End and MySQLi as Back End which not only simplifies the allocation process but also enhances recordkeeping and analysis capabilities. The system is enhanced by adding features to generate detailed reports in PDF and Excel formats. And also, the system enables comprehensive monitoring and analysis of NME allocation data.
